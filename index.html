          For much of history, women have been viewed as reflections of men, often seen as smaller, weaker versions of the male ideal. This perspective has influenced society in the education, employment, culture, and personal relationships. It's assumption that women are not as strong, not as smart, not as able to contribute as much as men has led to systemic discrimination, limiting women's opportunities. For much of history, women have been viewed as reflections of men, often seen as smaller, weaker versions of the male ideal.

           Medical research has historically excluded women, treating male bodies as the default. Heart attack symptoms, medication dosages, and diagnostic tools are often based on male physiology. Women's health issues are understudied, misunderstood, and misdiagnosed. We must design healthcare systems that recognize biological diversity and ensure equal care for all bodies.

            The menstrual cycle affects everything from cognitive performance to physical strength, yet it's rarely considered in design. From workplace policies that ignore hormonal fluctuations to fitness programs that don't account for cyclical changes, we must design systems that work with women's natural rhythms, not against them.

           Workplace safety standards, equipment, and policies are often designed around male workers. From construction hardhats that don't accommodate ponytails to uniforms that assume male body shapes, workplace design frequently puts women at risk. True workplace safety means protecting everyone, not just the traditional workforce.
